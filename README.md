# Welcome to GitHub

Welcome to GitHub—where millions of developers work together on software. Ready to get started? Let’s learn a few fundamentals, and then try them out by publishing your first GitHub Pages website!

## Repositories

Right now, we’re in your first GitHub **repository**. A repository is like a folder or file system for your project. Your project's repository contains its files such as code, documentation, images, and more. It also stores the history of changes to each file.

This repository contains two important files: The HTML code for your first website on GitHub and the README file. It also contains a folder with the images used in this README.

## Describe your Project

You are currently reading your project's README file. _README.md_ files are like cover pages or elevator pitches for your project. It is written in plain text  and usually includes: a paragraph describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.

## Your first website

**GitHub Pages** is a free and easy way to create a website using the code contained in your GitHub repositories. You can use GitHub Pages to build a portfolio, create a personal website, show someone the site you coded, or share documentation for your project. GitHub Pages is automatically enabled in this repository, but when you create new repositories in the future, you'll need to enable GitHub Pages to launch your site automatically.

## Publish your site

Your first GitHub website is automatically published at: https://your-username.github.io/. The HTML file—called `index.html`—is rendered as the home page and you'll be making changes to this file in the next step.

Congratulations! You just launched your first GitHub Pages website. It's now live to share with the entire world.

## Making your first edit

When you make any change to any file in your project, you’re making a **commit**. If you fix a typo, update a filename, or edit your code, you can add it to GitHub as a commit. Your commits represent your project’s entire history—and they’re all saved in your project’s repository.

With each commit, you have the opportunity to create a **commit message**, a short, meaningful comment about the change you’re making to a file. So you always know exactly what changed, no matter when you return to a commit.

## Practice: Customize your first Github website by writing HTML code

Want to edit the site you just published? Let’s practice commits by introducing yourself in your `index.html` file. Don’t worry about getting it right the first time—you can always build on your introduction later.

Let’s start with this template:

```
<H1>Hello World! I’m [username]. This is my website!</H1>
```

To add your introduction, copy our template and click the edit icon at the top right hand corner of the `index.html` file.

Then, paste the template and fill in the blanks.

When you’re done, scroll down to the `Commit changes` section of the edit page. Add a short message explaining your change, like "Add my introduction", then click `Commit changes`.

## Rename your repository 

 This repository is called “hello-world,” but most repositories are named after the projects they contain. To update your repository’s name, click the `Settings` tab on this page. This will take you to your repository’s settings page.

Under the **Repository Name** heading, type the new name of your repository. Then click **Rename**—and that’s it. When you’re done, click your repository name or browser’s back button to return to this page.
